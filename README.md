# Property Oracle

Property Oracle is a blockchain solution, built on <a target="_blank" href="https://substrate.io">substrate</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://kilt.io">kilt</a>, that helps people like you and me possess undisputed ownership and claim of their properties e.g a plot of land.
With Property Oracle, nobody can take what is yours and leave you with nothing.

## How does Property Oracle Work?

- A certain authority creates a property document and lists the fields that must be filled in the document.
- Users can then fill the document and submit it. This filled document is accessible to the user and authority.
- Signatures: People can append their signatures to the document as witnesses of ownership of the property. But the property document and its information is only considered true when the authority signs it. Probably after their proper investigation.
- The signatures are recorded on the blockchain and timestamped, thereby cememting an individuals claim to the property, from now to eternity. 
- Properties can be transferred from one individual to the other, e.g from father to son.
- All these interactions are recorded on the blockchain for transparency and security.
