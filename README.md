Property Oracle is a blockchain solution built on <a target="_blank" href="https://substrate.io">substrate</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://kilt.io">kilt</a>,  which empowers you to create an indisputable, irrefutable proof of ownership of your various properties. e.g a plot of land.
With Property Oracle, nobody can take what is yours and leave you with nothing.

## How does Property Oracle Work?

- A certain authority creates a property document and lists the fields that must be filled in the document.
- Users can then fill the document and submit it. This filled document is accessible to the user and authority.
- Signatures: People can append their signatures to the document as witnesses, confirming a users ownership of the property. But the property document and its information is only considered true and valid when the authority signs it. Probably after their proper investigation.
- The signatures are recorded on the blockchain and timestamped, thereby cementing an individuals claim to the property, from now to eternity. 
- Properties can be transferred from one individual to the other, e.g from father to son.
- All these interactions are recorded on the blockchain for transparency and security.
